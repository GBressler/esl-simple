# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

  about:
  about_html: <p>After graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in Spanish with a concentration in International Business as well as a certificate to Teach English as a Foreign Language (TEFL), I moved to Mexico to put what I had learned into practice.  While living in Mexico I met a large variety of students, worked in various institutes and in a multi-national company.  In July of 2013, I moved again, this time to Lima. Since I arrived I've discovered that Peru is a very diverse country with lots interesting, friendly people...and incredibly delicious food!  During my time here I've had opportunities to teach in various institutes, give private classes as well as teach in the Superintendencia de Banca y Seguros (SBS). <br> <br> You can find out more about me here <script src="//platform.linkedin.com/in.js" type="text/javascript"></script> <script type="IN/MemberProfile" data-id="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregbressler/es" data-format="hover" data-related="false" data-text="Greg Bressler"></script></p>

The material is full of activities as well as quizzes and exams to show how the student is progressing.  The American English File series coincides with the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages and covers levels A1 to B2 (Basic to High Intermediate)."</p>
